This repository contains a lot of the files I need when setting up a new environment, repository, or project.

Contents:

.vimrc - based very much on Gary Bernhardt's .vimrc.  See his github account for more information.

.vim/autload/ - contains pathogen.vim.

.vim/bundle/ - the vim plugins loaded by pathogen.  Contains the following.
  - Command-T - clone from https://github.com/wincent/Command-T.git
  - matchit - included.
  - vim-ruby-refactoring - clone from https://rossbeehler@github.com/rossbeehler/vim-ruby-refactoring.git

.vim/colors/ - the same color scheme as used in Destroy all Software screencasts.

script/ - Test scripts also stolen from Destroy all Software, with minor modifications to turn off rails support by default.
